# Movie_Recommendation_System
I've used the lightFM library to train a hybrid content-based + collaborative algorithm that uses the WARP loss function on the movielens dataset. [Movielens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) is a great source of movies and ratings from thousands of users. The model will create personalized movie recommendations in a setup environment (Terminal)
